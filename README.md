Artemis Financial, a financial services company was seeking to address software security vulnerabilities within their system. The company required a secure, reliable application to protect sensitive financial data, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of their operations. My task was to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities to improve the overall security of their software. One of the strengths of the project was the successful identification and mitigation of software security vulnerabilities, including the implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function for data integrity and the use of HTTPS for secure communications. Coding securely is critical as it protects against potential breaches, ensuring the company's data remains confidential and maintaining customer trust. Software security adds significant value to a company's overall well-being by safeguarding assets and upholding the company's reputation. A challenging yet insightful aspect of the project was conducting a thorough vulnerability assessment and refactoring the code without introducing new risks. I increased layers of security by implementing input sanitization to prevent cross-site scripting attacks and using the OWASP dependency-check tool to confirm the absence of new vulnerabilities. In the future, I would continue to use tools like static code analysis and threat modeling to assess vulnerabilities and select appropriate mitigation techniques. After refactoring, I conducted functional testing to ensure that the code executed without errors, and I ran dependency checks to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Utilizing secure coding practices, such as proper error handling and regular dependency checks, ensured that the application was both functional and secure. Key resources and tools from this project included the SHA-256 algorithm for cryptographic hashing, HTTPS for secure communications, and the OWASP dependency-check tool for static code analysis. These tools and practices will be very useful in future assignments. For future employers, I could showcase the vulnerability assessment report and demonstrate how I implemented industry-standard best practices to secure the applicationâ€‹.
